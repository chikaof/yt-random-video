This code makes a request to the YouTube API to get a list of the most popular videos and then randomly selects one. Note that you will need to obtain a YouTube API key in order to use this feature. More information on how to obtain an API key can be found in the YouTube API documentation (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).
